## Preface

This project is about an Arduino library for the SI470X device. __The communication protocol used by this library is the I²C__. This library can be freely distributed using the MIT Free Software model. 
The SI470X is a FM DSP receiver from Silicon Labs with RDS/RBDS support. This document is aimed at the Arduino developers, radio experimenters, hobbyists and anyone interested in building a receiver based on the Si470X and will show you Arduino source codes, schematics, examples and tips to help you to build a receiver based on Arduino board and the SI470X devices.

I think the best way to start a project based on this device is to acquire a breakout board like the one shown in the following figure.

## Si470X Library features

This library uses the I²C communication protocol and implements most of the functions offered by Si470X (SI4701/02/03) IC family from Silicon Labs. This library also has primitive functions that make it easier for you to implement commands that may not have been implemented yet. See [setAllRegisters, getAllRegisters, getStatus](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI470X/extras/apidoc/html/) functions. It is worth noting, however, that this library is constantly improving. Check the API documentation before implementing a new function. It is likely that your demand is already implemented. __The main features of this library are listed below__.


1. Open Source. It is free. You can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software. See [MIT License](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI470X/#mit-license) to know more.

3. C++ Language and Object-oriented programming. You can easily extend the SI470X class by adding more functionalities;
4. __Available on Arduino IDE (via Manage Libraries)__. Easy to install and use;
5. Seek tuning;
6. Automatic frequency control (AFC);
7. Automatic gain control (AGC);
8. Programmable FM Band ranges;
9. Programmable SPACE Settings;

13. Volume control (including mute audio);
14. RDS/RBDS Processor;
15. [Well-documented API](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI470X/extras/apidoc/html/).


## Library Installation


 The easiest method to install this library is via your Arduino IDE. All you have to do is:
 
 1. Select Tools menu;
 2. Select Manage Libraries option;
 3. In the text box (top windows), type PU2CLR or SI470X;
 4. Select the PU2CLR SI470X. 


The video below shows how you can install this library via your Arduino IDE from Manage Libraries tool.

### Installing via the repository 

With this approach, you will have the __most current version__ of the library. However, __it may not be the most stable version__. This is because the current version is always in development. [Prefer releases](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI470X/releases). Do you need some old version (release) of this library?  If yes, [check here](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI470X/releases).


First, you have to [download](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI470X/archive/master.zip) this library in zip format.  
After, unzip the SI470X-master.zip file in your Arduino Library folder. 

* On __Windows__: "My Documents\Arduino\libraries"
* On __MAC OS__: ˜/Documents/Arduino/libraries
* On __Linux__: ˜/Documents/Arduino/libraries

## SI470X and Registers

The SI4701/02/03 can be controlled by deal with register via I2C interface.  The tebla below was extracted from Silicon Labs; document Si4702/03-C19 - "BROADCAST FM RADIO TUNER FOR PORTABLE APPLICATIONS"; Rev 1.1; page 22. This table shows the set of register that you can used to controle the device.

Source: Silicon Labs; document Si4702/03-C19 - "BROADCAST FM RADIO TUNER FOR PORTABLE APPLICATIONS"; Rev 1.1; Page 22.

__Except that you need something very specific, the PU2CLR SI470X Arduino Library offers all the functions necessary for you to build your own FM receiver using an Arduino Board__.  If you need something else, this library implemented some basic functions to deal direct with the device registers shown above. See __getShadownRegister__, __setShadownRegister__, __setAllRegisters, getAllRegisters__ and __getStatus__ functions on [https://pu2clr.github.io/SI470X/extras/apidoc/html/](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI470X/extras/apidoc/html/).



## Schematic

As previously reported, in general, the SI4703 device is already sold in kit or breakout board format. So, the circuit below can help you to connect the arduino to the shield. In this case, you will not need the crystal, pull up resistors, capacitors and audio jack output. Also, the labels will guide you.  The table bellow shows the connections.

### Voltage operation

* __The SI470X device is a 3.3V part. If you are not using a 3.3V version of Arduino, you have to use a kind of 5V to 3.3V bidirectional converter. It is important to say that just power the Si470X device with 3.3V from Arduino board is not enough. You have to be aware that the Arduino that operates with 5V, the digital pins and the I2C bus will send 5V signals to the Si470X device. That configuration can make the system unstable or damage the Si47XX device. If you are using a breakout board based on SI470X, check its operating voltage before connecting it to you 5V Arduino Board.__
